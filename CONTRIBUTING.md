```

## 🎨 Style Guidelines

### Java Code Style

We follow the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) with minor modifications.

**Key Points:**
- **Indentation:** 4 spaces (no tabs)
- **Line Length:** 120 characters max
- **Braces:** K&R style (opening brace on same line)
- **Naming:**
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Methods/Variables: `camelCase`
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
  - Packages: `lowercase`

**Example:**

```java
@Service
public class UserService {
    private static final int MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3;
    
    private final UserRepository userRepository;
    
    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }
    
    public User findUserById(Long userId) {
        return userRepository.findById(userId)
            .orElseThrow(() -> new UserNotFoundException(userId));
    }
}
```

### Spring Boot Best Practices

- ✅ Use constructor injection (not `@Autowired` on fields)
- ✅ Keep controllers thin, logic in services
- ✅ Use DTOs for API requests/responses
- ✅ Validate input with `@Valid`
- ✅ Handle exceptions with `@ControllerAdvice`
- ✅ Use proper HTTP status codes
- ✅ Document APIs with Swagger/OpenAPI

            ├── service/         # Service tests
            └── integration/     # Integration tests
```

### Testing Standards

- ✅ Write unit tests for all business logic
- ✅ Integration tests for critical flows
- ✅ Aim for 80%+ code coverage
- ✅ Use meaningful test names: `should_ReturnUser_When_ValidIdProvided()`
- ✅ Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert

**Example:**

```java
@Test
void should_CreateUser_When_ValidDataProvided() {
    // Arrange
    UserDTO userDTO = new UserDTO("test@example.com", "password123");
    
    // Act
    User result = userService.createUser(userDTO);
    
    // Assert
    assertNotNull(result);
    assertEquals("test@example.com", result.getEmail());
    verify(userRepository, times(1)).save(any(User.class));
}
```
